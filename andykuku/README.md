Hello!

I've made this little script that allow you to init, compile and run an Android Project. I tried to make it as simple as possible to allow you to understand and modify it easily. If you think there is a very important missing feature, don't hesitate to do a pull request on Github and I will answer quickly.

To use it, check this tutorial:

Thanks!
